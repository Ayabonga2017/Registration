when you add - you should check if the value is in the map

if it is not in the map -> it should add it to the map -> return true
if it is in the map -> it should return false

someone enters a reg number...
get the reg number from the DOM
try to add this regnumber to the Map - using the FacFunc
if the FacFunc return false - don't add it to the DOM
if the FacFunc return true - add it to the DOM


For filtering...?!
