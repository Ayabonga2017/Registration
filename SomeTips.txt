map

when you add - you should check if the value is in the map

if it is not in the map -> it should add it to the map -> return true
if it is in the map -> it should return false

someone enters a reg number...
get the reg number from the DOM
try to add this regnumber to the Map - using the FacFunc
if the FacFunc return false - don't add it to the DOM
if the FacFunc return true - add it to the DOM
You do have to remember to include a return statement in your callback.
If you don't, you'll get a new array filled with undefined.
map returns an array with the finished product, rather than requiring us to mutate an array inside the loop.

For filtering...?!

the syntax:
var newArray = arr.filter(callback(element[, index[, array]])[, thisArg])

 # element - The current element being processed in the array.
# index- The index of the current element being processed in the array.
# array- The array filter was called upon.
# thisArg - the Value to use as this when executing callback.

It takes an array, and filters out unwanted elements.
It's available on any array, and you pass it a callback as its first argument.
filter executes that callback on each element of the array,
and spits out a new array containing only the elements for which the callback returned true
filter has three arguments like in the map:
The current item
The current index
The array you called filter on

With filter, you also have to include a return statement, and you must make sure it returns a boolean value.
Always make sure your callbacks include an explicit return statement.
 And always make sure your callbacks in filter return true or false.
 when filtering two registratrion numbers  that startswith("CA") { eg. CApe Town :CA & George :CAW } remember to put the space on CA,
 so that it cannot include George on the array that is called upon to filter.

 JavaScript String indexOf() Method

 The indexOf() method returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string.
This method returns -1 if the value to search for never occurs.
Use this method so that your registration input does not add the wrong data to your registration list.
